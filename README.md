Welcome To League of Lore's frontend!

### Getting Started 
   To get started we first need to make sure we have our backend up and running we can find that on my github profile title League of Lore backend or copy this link https://github.com/Elandi13/League-of-Lore-Backend. Once we have cloned the backend follow the instructions that can be found in the README.md. 
   
   
### What to Expect?
    League of Lore is a fairly simple web application that lets you explore the world of Runeterra and uncover some knowledge about ecah champion and region. Feel free to write new stories onto each champion and of course be sure to visit the regions where these champions come from. 
    
### Deployment
   Now that our backend is up and running we need to npm install to make sure we have all the correct packages installed. Once that is complete we can finally get the app up and running. Just type into the terminal npm start and it will prompt you to open the app on another localhost.
